### Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, and understanding natural language. AI can be categorized into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed for a specific task, and General AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

### Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms that analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. Common types of ML include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

### Neural Networks
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Each connection has a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. Deep learning, a subfield of ML, involves neural networks with many layers and is used in applications like image recognition and speech processing.

### Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. It combines linguistics, computer science, and AI. NLP is used in chatbots, translation tools, and sentiment analysis. Techniques include tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.

### Applications of AI
AI is used in numerous domains. In healthcare, AI helps in diagnosing diseases and personalizing treatment. In finance, it detects fraud and automates trading. In transportation, AI powers self-driving cars. It also enhances user experience in entertainment through personalized recommendations.
